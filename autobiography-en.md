# Autobiography
I'm Hong-Jen Kao, 24. I love reading, and reads a lot of literature, programming-related books, and blog posts.
When I was a freshman in high school, for the first time in forever, I wrote my first C program in a computer course, and start loving writing computer program since then.
When I study at NCTU CS, I have been strictly trained. I made my best to implement course projects, and learned a lot. Since I love programming, I often devote myself to a topic that interests me. Excpt blogging, I have sent patches to open source projects.

## I'm equiped with OO knowledge and git experience.
Many courses in NCTU CS have collaborative term-project. In the term-project of the course "Introduction to Software Engineering", I was responsible for system architecture, class hierarchy design and GUI (with Java Swing). In the term-project of the course "Introduction to Computer Organization", I was responsible for wiring up several modules, and implementing some of them.
Experienced colleborate with others, I observed that there are several difficulties to be overcome. In the view of programming, the more modular the system is, the more easier to divide the work, since changing the interface between modules involves a lot communication.
Because of the observation, I started to learn knowledge of Software Engineering widly, such as refactoring, object-oriented design pattern, design principle, test-driven development.
As for the problem of merging each other's code, programmers use version control system to tackle it. So I choose git and use it on several projects for 2 years.

## I have the ability to program the front-end and back-end of a website.
From Sep. 2012, I got a part-time job at TKU, writing web-based systems that collects research data, and a web-based system that used in lectures, letting students give and solve problem.
At Sep. 2013, I joined BEER RUN Taiwan and was responsible for building the [official website][beerrun.tw]. This site eventually got 20,000 likes from facebook.
This May, I attended HackNTU 2014 together with 3 friends. Our product was a WebApp helping a group of people to figure our their common available time, named [CalShare][CalShare]. In this project I made the front-end for it, with AngularJS and Google Calendar API within 25 hours.
After enlisted, I got a chance to develope a content management system from the ground up. In the condition that development machine cannot connect to WWW, I used Laravel to develope a RESTful Web Service, and made a SPA with AngularJS on my own. And it works well on IE8.

## I am used to self-study, and have problem-solving ability.
When I encounter problems, I would utilize Google and StackOverflow to solve them. And I aggressively use Twitter, RSS, and newsletter to follow topics with interest. Now I pay attention to functional programming and front-end web design.
