Keep log of my English writing, so that I can observe how it evolves.

Another benefit of place it on GitHub is, one can leave comment on specific line.

Suggestions welcome!

Below are tools I use to convert markdown file to PDF.

[Resume][resume] is perfect for resume, its beautiful font outbeats [markdown-pdf][markdown-pdf].

Though, [markdown-pdf][markdown-pdf] is appropriate for autobiography. And it support custom CSS!
