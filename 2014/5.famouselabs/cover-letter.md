Hi Evo,


Hello, my name is Hong-Jen Kao. On Inside Job Board I found that Famous Labs is hiring at Taipei. I want to apply Front-end/JS developer.

I am a Bachelor of Science of National Chiao-Tung University, department of Computer Science. I learn new things quickly, and have the ability to implement an idea in short time. As outlined in my resume, I have experience on Web development, both front-end and back-end, and AngularJS is my friend. I care about the quality of code. With experience and enthusiasm, I believe I'm the best person for this job.

I really want to work at Famous Labs. Thank you for your consideration, and hope to receive your response. If you need more information, please contact me.


Sincerely,  
Hong-Jen Kao
